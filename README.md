# Udagram Image Filtering Application

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into two parts:
1. Frontend - Angular web application built with Ionic Framework
2. Backend RESTful API - Node-Express application

## Strategy
The strategy consist in having the backend splitted in three microservices:
1. udagram-gateway: which will route the request from the front end to the specific microservice
2. udagram-feeds: will handle the feeds database and AWS S3
3. udagram-user: will handle the user database and authorization

## Getting Started


### Frontend App
* To download all the package dependencies, run the command from the directory `udagram-frontend/`:
    ```bash
    npm install .
    ```
* Install Ionic Framework's Command Line tools for us to build and run the application:
    ```bash
    npm install -g ionic
    ```
* Prepare your application by compiling them into static files.
    ```bash
    ionic build
    ```
* Run the application locally using files created from the `ionic build` command.
    ```bash
    ionic serve
    ```
* You can visit `http://localhost:8100` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a web interface.
